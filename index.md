# About me

I am a student in my Senior year @ Purdue University. I study Computer Science with a concentration on Software Engineering. I love to travel and eat. Hopefully one day, I can travel to every corner of the world and stuff my face along the way.

Welcome to my online home where you can see some of my blogs and projects I am working on. Have something to tell me? You can drop me a line at [me@hellowilliam.com](mailto:me@hellowilliam.com).
