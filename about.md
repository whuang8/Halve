I am a Software Engineer @ [Enova International](https://www.enova.com). I call Chicago my home and can often be found exploring the Windy City for the best eats. Photography and videography are some developing interests of mine. 

Welcome to my online home where you can see some of my writing. Have something to tell me? You can drop me a line at [me@hellowilliam.com](mailto:me@hellowilliam.com).
